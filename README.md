# Neural Network Project

## Abstract

Design and train a Deep Neural Network using TensorFlow to predict the toxicity of drug molecules from the their chemical expressions.​

I used CNN for this project.

## Data

A list of drug molecules and their SMILES expressions, and the binary label of whether toxic or not.​

## Environment

Python 3​ & TensorFlow 1.15.0
